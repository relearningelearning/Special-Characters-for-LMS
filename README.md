# Special-Characters-for-LMS
Begin to understand special characters and more that educators and support staff can begin to integrate into their own course sites on any LMS. Using special characters in Learning Management Systems (LMS) can enhance student user experience by:

* improving content clarity and context,
* enabling more effective communication of information,
* supporting accessibility for all learners,
* enhancing the overall visual and textual presentation.

The Special Characters code was developed as a resource for web designers, educators, and support staff working with LMS tools to:
* easily find and understand various special characters,
* apply appropriate Unicode symbols for their educational content when needed,
* ensure their content is both precise and accessible,
* encourage thoughtful use of characters to enhance learning materials.

This Special Characters resource is intended to be used as a guide to discover and use symbols in their curriculum. It serves as an educational resource that helps educators ensure the readability, accessibility, and effectiveness of their learning materials.

## Instructions:
Simply copy and paste the [Special-Characters.html](/Special-Characters.html) code into your LMS HTML editor to discover special characters you can leverage in your curriculum LMS you are using.
